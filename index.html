								<br><b>My First Research Experience (2005-2006): </b> 
								<br> During my bachelor in Medicine, (residency training), I worked on one clinical trial and project studying the effect of meteorological fluctuation on asthma attacks in the emergency room, under the supervision of Dr. B V MuraliMohan (MRCP, UK).  
								
								<br>Through data collection and analysis of 13 hospitals across the city, we identified that the average temperature, particulate matter (PM), and nitrogen dioxide play a major role in acute asthma admission, with PM and NO2 having a lag effect for 5 days.  
								
								<br>This research was selected for an oral presentation at the National Pulmonologists Conference (NAPCON 2005) and was published later on.

								<br><b>MD Thesis (2007-2010): </b>
								
								<br> In my experience of working as a shift worker (2005-2008), the stress involved in hospital settings during the night times was immense.
								
								<br> As a fresh MD student, I conceptualized the idea of probably impaired cardiovascular responses in shift workers and early detection of the same for my MD thesis.
								
								<br> I showed that insomnia for just 1 week in shift workers led to a reduction in heart rate variability (HRV), which is a precursor risk for future heart diseases 
								
								<br> For this work, I won the Prof. N. Padmanabhan Memorial Award - best paper by any Postgraduate student in Cardiovascular Physiology – Instituted by <a href="https://iabms.in/"<b>Indian association of biomedical sciences (IABMS),India</b></a>.

								<br> I completed 3 funded projects (as Principal Investigator) - ~65k€
																
								<br> Funded by <a href="https://www.icmr.gov.in/">Indian Council of Medical Research</a> and <a href="http://www.rguhs.ac.in/">Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences</a>. 
								
								<br> The research broadly covered preventive strategies for non-communicable disorders. 
																			
								<br> I studied the effect of lifestyle modification versus added acoustic stimulation using Indian music to reduce hypertension/prehypertension among patients. 
								
								<br> Later I studied over 400 healthy individuals for neuro and cardiovascular effects of acoustic stimulation with different melodic scales of music. 
								
								<br> For this, I included biomarkers of stress and anxiety scales along with heart rate variability and electroencephalography as parameters.

								<b>Teaching:</b>
								<br> I was an Assistant Professor in a medical school that involved higher teaching responsibilities, from 2010 to 2021. 
								<br> I was in the department of Medical Physiology, teaching Theory and Practical Human Physiology.
								<br> I taught and prepared course materials for over 13 streams of undergraduate studies which included Medical, Dental, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Engineering, and more.
								<br> I was the teacher in-charge for Nursing course, that handled over 60 hours of theory and over 100 students each year.
								<br> I was also Departmental Library Incharge where we had over 400 books, purchased and donated by senior Professors in Physiology.
								<br> I was also an active cultural committee member for my tenure as an Assistant Professor.
								<br> I led the effort to obtain a certificate from the Department of Science and Industry (DSIR), Government of India which helped in recognizing the institute's work Nationally.

								<b>Organizer:</b>
								<br> I organized a two-day workshop - ‘Neuroscience 2017’ - Science academies lecture workshop on ‘Recent advances in brain health & diseases’ 
								<br> For this I collaborated with Dr Ambarish Vijayaraghava, MD, Ph.D, Physiology.
								<br> This was one of its kind symposium that involved 13 neuroscientists of international repute and over 170 attendees. 
								<br> For this, I secured a grant of 1.10 Lakhs INR from the <a href="https://www.ias.ac.in/"<b>Indian Academy of Sciences</b></a>, Govt of India. 
								<br> I received an Appreciation letter, for meticulous organization, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._S._Shashidhara"<b>Prof L S Shashidhara</b></a>, EMBO Associate Member and Distinguished Visiting Professor of Biology, Ashoka University, and Professor and Chair of Biology, IISER Pune, India.
